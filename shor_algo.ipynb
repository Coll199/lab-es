    "<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n",
    "The purpose of Shor's Algorithm is to factorize integers.\n",
    "Integer factorization is the decomposition of an composite integer into a product of smaller integers, for example, the integer $42$ can be factored into $2 \\times 21$. If these factors are restricted to prime numbers, the process is called prime factorization, for example, the prime factorization of $42$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 7$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for integer factorization formulated in [1994](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539795293172). It is arguably the most dramatic example of how the paradigm of quantum computing changed our perception of which computational problems should be considered tractable, motivating the study of new quantum algorithms and efforts to design and construct quantum computers. It also has expedited research into new cryptosystems not based on integer factorization. \n"

    "When the integers are very large, no efficient classical integer factorization algorithm is known. The hardest factorization problems are semiprime numbers, the product of two prime numbers. In [2009](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-14623-7_18), a team of researchers factored a 232 decimal digit semiprime number (768 bits), spending the computational equivalent of more than two thousand years on a single core 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron processor with 2 GB RAM:\n",

    "Shor's algorithm has been experimentally realised by multiple teams for specific composite integers. The composite $15$ was first factored into $3 \\times 5$ in [2001](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6866/full/414883a.html) using seven NMR qubits, and has since been implemented using four photon qubits in 2007 by [two](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.250504) [teams](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.250505), three solid state qubits in [2012](https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n10/full/nphys2385.html) and five trapped ion qubits in [2016](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1068). The composite $21$ has also been factored into $3 \\times 7$ in [2012](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n11/full/nphoton.2012.259.html) using a photon qubit and qutrit (a three level system). Note that these experimental demonstrations rely on significant optimisations of Shor's algorithm based on apriori knowledge of the expected results. In general, [$2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\log_2N$](https://link-springer-com.virtual.anu.edu.au/chapter/10.1007/3-540-49208-9_15) qubits are needed to factor the composite integer $N$, meaning at least $1,154$ qubits would be needed to factor $RSA-768$ above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor’s algorithm is composed of three parts. The first part turns the factoring problem into a period finding problem using number theory, which can be computed on a classical computer. The second part  finds the period using the quantum Fourier transform and is responsible for the quantum speedup of the algorithm. The third part uses the period found to calculate the factors.\n",

    "### From Factorization to Period Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "The number theory that underlines Shor's algorithm relates to periodic modulo sequences. Let's have a look at an example of such a sequence. Consider the sequence of the powers of two: \n",
    "$$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ...$$\n",
    "Now let's look at the same sequence 'modulo 15', that is, the remainder after fifteen divides each of these powers of two:\n",
    "$$1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, 4, ...$$\n",
    "This is a modulo sequence that repeats every four numbers, that is, a periodic modulo sequence with a period of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction of factorization of $N$ to the problem of finding the period of an integer $x$ less than $N$ and greater than $1$ depends on the following result from number theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The function $\\mathcal{F}(a) = x^a \\bmod N$ is a periodic function, where $x$ is an integer coprime to $N$ and $a \\ge 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that two numbers are coprime, if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor being 1. For example, 8 and 15 are coprime, as they don't share any common factors (other than 1). However, 9 and 15 are not coprime, since they are both divisible by 3 (and 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Since $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ is a periodic function, it has some period $r$. Knowing that $x^0 \\bmod N = 1$, this means that $x^r \\bmod N = 1$ since the function is periodic, and thus $r$ is just the first nonzero power where $x^r = 1 (\\bmod N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information and through the following algebraic manipulation: \n",
    "$$ x^r \\equiv 1 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "$$ x^r = (x^{r/2})^2 \\equiv 1 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "$$ (x^{r/2})^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "and if $r$ is an even number:\n",
    "$$ (x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, the product $(x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1)$ is an integer multiple of $N$, the number to be factored. Thus, so long as $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ is not a multiple of $N$, then at least one of $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ must have a nontrivial factor in common with $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So computing $\\text{gcd}(x^{r/2} - 1, N)$ and $\\text{gcd}(x^{r/2} + 1, N)$ will obtain a factor of $N$, where $\\text{gcd}$ is the greatest common denominator function, which can be calculated by the polynomial time [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). \n",
